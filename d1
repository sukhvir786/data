Academy Foundation Course Project Outline

Project Objectives:

· Analyze real-time attack events.

· Propose mitigation or ways to minimize the vulnerabilities associated with a required service.

· Devise an action plan for setting up a secured client/server connection.

Requirements:

Visit one of the following (or another similar) sites which displays real time attack statistics:

(It may take several minutes for the attack maps to display captured data.)

· Analyze: Identify one specific service / port / protocol that repeatedly displays as being attacked.

· Research: Describe a real world scenario where that particular service would be required.

· Solve: Explain in your own terms a process (Solution) that would be used to setup a secured trust relationship between the server which delivers that service and a legitimate client requester.
